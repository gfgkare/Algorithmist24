Job Sequencing:**The job sequencing problem is a combinatorial optimization problem of finding the optimal order to sequence a set of jobs on a machine, such that the total time to complete all the jobs is minimized. The problem is NP-hard, which means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it. However, there are a number of approximation algorithms that can be used to find good solutions to the problem in polynomial time.

**47. Aho-Corasick algorithm:** The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a string searching algorithm that efficiently finds all occurrences of multiple keywords (also known as "patterns") in a given input text. It was developed by Alfred V. Aho and Margaret J. Corasick in 1975 and is commonly used in text processing applications like string matching, intrusion detection systems, and keyword-based searching.
